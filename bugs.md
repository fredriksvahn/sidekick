in tui mode, add logic to copy an answer orat least mark and scroll to copy a part of an answer thats not visible without scrolling. as for now we can only copy whats visible currently in the window but if we need to copy content that goes beying rendered content we need to be able to scroll while mainting marked content.


on `sidekick contexts` use bubblegum or something to let me jump into the context like a chat, load context into window.
